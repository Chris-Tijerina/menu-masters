The user will be able to:

- Add recipes
- Include a picture
- Upvote favorites
- Comment
- Delete/Edit recipes

## Instruction

> The application is fully deployed to Heroku at the site linked above. If you want to use it, feel free to follow the link and sign up for the site in order to log in and make posts.

> If you are looking to use these files as a template. You will have to download the repository, or fork it and clone it, and open it up in your chosen terminal (Vs.Code, GitBash, Terminal for Mac, etc.). It will require that you have mySQL installed and have access to a user account with access to databases (these will be placed into a .env file. Check out the documentation on Dotenv to see how to set it up). Then you will have to ensure that node package manager(NPM) has been installed so that you can install all the dependencies (using "npm install" in the terminal). Most importantly you will need to change the username and password in the `const connection` to whatever your username and password for your mySQL is. I would suggest using a `.env` file through Dotenv in order to make this more secure. Once you've got all the dependencies installed, you can use the terminal to log into mySQL and run the ` source db/schema.sql` command to create the database, before exiting the mySQL and using the terminal to run `node seeds/index.js` to create and populate the newly created database. of course, you may want to make changes to the seeds, styling, and others if you intend to deploy it yourself.
